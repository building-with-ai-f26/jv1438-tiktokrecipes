# 🥕 Fridge to Feast

> **One-line pitch:** Meal prep for busy people: keep a list of what's in your kitchen, plan the week's recipes (ideas from what you have, or a TikTok recipe), get a grocery list with exact amounts, and update your kitchen in one tap.

- **Builder:** Juhi Vyas (`@jv1438`)
- **Pod:** Pod M5
- **Product Page & Living PRD:** https://building-with-ai-f26.github.io/jv1438-tiktokrecipes/
- **App:** runs locally through Week 4; add a cloud URL in Build 5.

## Start here: Build 1

**Due Monday, November 9 at noon, New York time.** No class November 3; keep building that week.

1. Join the [class organization](https://github.com/building-with-ai-f26), then use this template to create a **public** repo named `<netid>-<project-slug>`. Ask Christian or Hew if the organization is missing from the owner list.
2. Set up Git and one coding agent during the week of October 27. Follow the [Icerynk setup guide](https://www.icerynk.com/c/fa26-tech-gb-2160-dm2-f2/content/pre-class-setup-github-openrouter-your-coding-agent).
3. Publish [`docs/index.html`](./docs/index.html): **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → main → /docs → Save**. When deployment finishes, open `https://building-with-ai-f26.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`.
4. Fill in PRD v1: a reachable user, their painful before/after workflow, one core workflow, and three non-goals.
5. Build a rough local prototype. Add a screenshot or GIF and an honest Build 1 log to the Product Page, including progress, learning, problems, costs, and hours.
6. Push meaningful commits on **at least two separate days each week outside class**, including the November 3 break.
7. Submit your **Product Page URL and repository URL in Icerynk**. Come ready to demo the prototype in two minutes on November 10.

Create your PostHog account in Week 1. Install it on the Product Page and local app in **Build 2**, then verify events. The Product Page is public from Build 1; the app can stay local through Week 4.

## Local setup

Clone **your own repository** and ask your coding agent to document the exact install and run commands here and in `AGENTS.md`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/building-with-ai-f26/jv1438-tiktokrecipes.git
cd jv1438-tiktokrecipes
cp .env.example .env        # then paste your OpenRouter key into .env
node --env-file=.env server.js
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Needs Node.js 20.6 or newer. No `npm install` required.

### How the app works

| Tab | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| 🧊 **Kitchen** | Add what you have (typed, quick-add buttons, or paste a list). Flag ⏰ items to use up soon. Set your pantry staples (spices, oils, sauces) once; recipes use them and the grocery list skips them. Saved in your browser. |
| 🍳 **Plan** | Set meals × people for the week. Get recipe ideas from your kitchen, or add one from a TikTok link, typed/pasted text, or a screenshot from any website. Set portions per recipe. "I cooked this" clears used-up items. |
| 🛒 **List** | Grocery list scaled to your portions, minus what you have, grouped by store section. Tick items off, copy the list, and "I bought these" moves them into your kitchen. |

Server endpoints in `server.js`: `/api/suggest`, `/api/extract` (TikTok), `/api/grocery`. Models are set in `.env`: `OPENROUTER_MODEL` (default `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, about $0.0003 per request, needs OpenRouter credits) and `OPENROUTER_VISION_MODEL` for screenshots (default `openrouter/free`, $0). Setting `OPENROUTER_MODEL=openrouter/free` makes everything free, but slower and less consistent.

If your app needs API keys, use a local environment file such as `.env`. Keep private keys out of source code, browser code, screenshots, and commits. The template ignores `.env`; `.env.example` contains placeholders only.
